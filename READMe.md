### Welcome to Browser-based virtual machine challenge! You will push your code here.

#### Description
1. If you don't have one already, create an Azure account. You should be able to access free Azure credits for students.
2. Research APIs to connect to a virtual machine in your browser.
3. Select and implement the best option you find. This should be a usable computer, running on Azure, which you interact with from your browser.
4. Imagine this is the only computer you can ever use; what features would you add? Brainstorm and write a numbered list of features in the readme file, prioritized in descending order. 
5. Create a 2 minute Youtube video to give an overview of what you've built. Screen Share your product, say what API you used, and explain the most important features that you've listed in step 4.

Bonus: implement some of the features on your list from step 4 and say how you implemented them.
